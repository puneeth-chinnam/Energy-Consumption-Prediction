# Energy-Consumption-Prediction
Introduction: The driving force behind this project is the urgent concern of climate change. Our world is currently facing a state of turmoil caused by excessive greenhouse gas emissions, such as CO2, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide, resulting from activities like transportation, burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), deforestation, and various man-made disasters. While climate change is influenced by multiple factors, the primary contributor remains to be the excessive consumption of energy through the burning of fossil fuels. The global demand for energy used in cooling has more than tripled since the 1990s, and without efficient standards, this demand could triple or even quadruple by 2040, significantly impacting our environment. It is projected that by 2050, approximately 4 billion people will own air conditioners. The operations of buildings, particularly heating and cooling, account for 28% of total greenhouse gas emissions. The environmental impact of cooling or heating a building is considerable. The objective of this project is to predict the energy consumption of a building, specifically through its HVAC systems (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Systems). The amount of energy consumed directly corresponds to its environmental impact. This project serves as a small step toward identifying energy consumption patterns, which can facilitate improvements in HVAC systems to reduce carbon emissions and their impact on the world.
